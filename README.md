# AirBnB Clone Project! üè†‚ú®
The goal of this project is to get practical experience in developing a simple booking and management system using AirBnB as a case study. 
A good booking system should have a simple but lovely UI/UX that allows users to perform basic functionalities.

## Project Goals üéØ
At the end of this project, I will have developed adequate knowledge and skills to implement any type of system. You will:

1. Understand the project scope.
2. Identify key features to be implemented.
3. Adhere to designated timelines and milestones.
4. Utilize the necessary tools and technologies.
5. Fulfill your roles and responsibilities within the project.

## Technologies Used üíª

Frontend: React with TypeScript, Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation, TailwindCSS for styling.
Backend: Python, Django, and MySQL (for illustration purposes; the backend is not the primary focus).
Other Tools: Redux or Context API for state management, REST for API integration, Jest for testing.

## UI/UX Design Planning.

### Design goals
Key features to be implemented: üõ†Ô∏è
1. Property Listings: Display properties with relevant details and images.
2. Booking System: Allow users to book properties, view booking details, and manage bookings.
3. Search Functionality: Enable users to search for properties based on various criteria (location, price, availability).
4. User Authentication: Secure login and registration for users.
